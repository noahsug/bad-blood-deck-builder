Bad Blood Deck Builder
======================

This program answers the following question:  
Given a list of cards that I own, and a set of opponents that I want to beat, what is the best deck I can build?

To answer this question, every possible deck the player could use is considered. Each possible deck plays a large number of games against each opponent. The win percentage against each opponent is totalled to give the deck's score.
